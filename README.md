# Emotion Recognition through Facial Analysis Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions. Utilizing computer vision techniques and a deep learning library named DeepFace, the system identifies seven key emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality. By analyzing facial features, the model determines the dominant emotion present in a given image, providing an accurate and real-time output. This innovative approach enhances human-computer interaction and has potential applications in mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and interactive gaming, offering valuable insights into emotional states.
